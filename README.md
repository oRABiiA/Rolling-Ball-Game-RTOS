# Rolling-Ball-Game-RTOS
A retro-style console game built in C for DOS, where the player controls a rolling ball across lanes while avoiding obstacles, collecting points, and sliding through ramps. The game uses direct video memory manipulation (0xB8000) for rendering, and inline x86 assembly for keyboard input handling.
